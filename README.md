# Whatsapp-Reminder-Sender

# This Python code utilizes the Twilio API to send a WhatsApp reminder message. Twilio is a cloud communications platform that allows developers to integrate messaging, voice, and other communication services into their applications.

# Here's a breakdown of the code:

# Importing necessary modules:
from twilio.rest import Client: Imports the Twilio client for sending messages.
from datetime import datetime, timedelta: Imports modules for handling date and time.

# Twilio credentials:

account_sid: Your Twilio account SID (string).
auth_token: Your Twilio authentication token (string). You can obtain this from your Twilio account.
twilio_phone_number: Your Twilio phone number (string). This is the Twilio phone number you've obtained.
your_phone_number: Your WhatsApp phone number (string). Make sure to include the country code (e.g., +91 for India).
# Creating a Twilio client:

client = Client(account_sid, auth_token): Initializes a Twilio client using your account SID and authentication token.
Calculating the reminder time:

reminder_time = datetime.now() + timedelta(minutes=10): Calculates the reminder time, which is set to 10 minutes from the current time.
# Formatting the reminder message:

reminder_message = "Don't forget your important task!": Defines the reminder message that will be sent.
# Sending the reminder message:

message = client.messages.create(...): Sends the reminder message using the create method of the Twilio messages resource.
to: The recipient's WhatsApp phone number in the format "whatsapp:{your_phone_number}".
from_: Your Twilio WhatsApp phone number.
body: The message content.
date_sent: The time when the message should be sent, calculated based on the reminder_time.
Printing the result:

print(f"Reminder message sent: {message.sid}"): Prints the SID (Service ID) of the sent message, indicating that the reminder message has been sent successfully.
# Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual Twilio account SID, authentication token, Twilio phone number, and WhatsApp phone number before running the code. Additionally, you need to have a Twilio account and a WhatsApp-enabled Twilio phone number to use this code.
